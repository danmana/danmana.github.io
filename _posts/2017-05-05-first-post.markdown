Hi, my name is Dan, and this is my developer blog.
I'll write here about my experiments trying out new technologies and personal projects I might undertake.

The main reason I stated this blog is to force myself to be more active, to play with new technologies and try to implement at least some of the ideas I have.

If nothing else this blog will be a record of what I've tried so far, and what I've learned; a reminder of sorts.

On the other side, who knows what I might stumble upon if I start putting my ideas into practice :)

Above all, this should be fun :)
